# Refined Storage CRT
A green CRT themed resource pack for Refined Storage 1.6.x

The layout of the various screens (grids, monitors etc) are inspired by the original Refined Storage textures by CyanideX.
The textures for the screens were created from scratch.
The remaining blue elements in the various Refined Storage devices are colored green with textures from VT-14's Refined Storage Recolor series.

Any remaining textures, such as the outlines of the monitors and grids, and any other devices, are untouched.
Because this resourcepack relies on the default Refined Storage textures, it's probably not going to work properly with other resource packs for Refined Storage. YMMV.
